This is the app, which can help you to work with your own database of languages! You have to prepare files .csv and/or .kml (description of format is in program). To run the app you have to download it and with a help of IDLE/PyCharm to start. Finally just write http://localhost:5001/site/main.html in your browser and it will work!
